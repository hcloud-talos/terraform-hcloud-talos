# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Setup

Before making commits, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

This installs:

- **pre-commit hooks**: Terraform formatting, validation, and security checks
- **commit-msg hook**: Validates commit messages follow conventional commits format

## Commit Message Format

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This is enforced
by commitlint both locally (pre-commit hook) and in CI (pull requests).

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Example

```
feat(network): add support for IPv6 alias IPs

Add configuration option to enable IPv6 on alias IPs for control plane
high availability setups.

BREAKING CHANGE: The `enable_alias_ip` variable now requires explicit
IPv6 configuration.
Closes #123
```

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Install pre-commit hooks (see Setup section)
4. Make your changes
5. Run quality checks:
   ```bash
   terraform fmt -recursive
   terraform init
   terraform validate
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
6. Commit using conventional commit format
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a pull request against `main`

## Pull Request Process

- CI will validate all commits in your PR
- Terraform format, validation, and security checks must pass
- Commit messages must follow a conventional commits format
- CI will post a comment with validation results
