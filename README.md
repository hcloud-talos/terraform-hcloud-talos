## Goals 🚀

| Goals                                                                               | Status | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Use private networks for the internal communication of the cluster                  | ✅      |                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Do not expose the Kubernetes and Talos API to the public internet via Load-Balancer | ✅      | Actually, the APIs are exposed to the public internet, but secured via the `firewall_use_current_ip` flag and a firewall rule that only allows traffic from one IP address.                         |
| Possibility to change alls CIDRs of the networks                                    | ⁉️     | Needs to be tested.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Configure the Cluster as good as possible to run in the Hetzner Cloud               | ✅      | This includes manual configuration of the network devices and not via DHCP, provisioning of Floating IPs (VIP), etc.                                                                                |

## Information about the Module

- A lot of information can be found directly in the descriptions of the variables.
- You can configure the module to create a cluster with 1, 3 or 5 control planes and n workers or only the control
  planes.
- It allows scheduling pods on the control planes if no workers are created.
- It has [Multihoming](https://www.talos.dev/v1.6/introduction/prodnotes/#multihoming) configuration (etcd and kubelet
  listen on public and private IP).
- It uses [KubePrism](https://www.talos.dev/v1.6/kubernetes-guides/configuration/kubeprism/)
  as [cluster endpoint](https://www.talos.dev/v1.6/reference/cli/#synopsis-9).
- If `cluster_api_host` is set, then you should create a corresponding DNS record pointing to either one control plane, the load balancer,
  floating IP, or alias IP.
  If `cluster_api_host` is not set, then a record for `kube.[cluster_domain]` should be created.
  It totally depends on your setup.

## Additional installed software in the cluster

### [Cilium](https://cilium.io/)

- Cilium is a modern, efficient, and secure networking and security solution for Kubernetes.
- It is used [Cilium as the CNI instead of the
  default Flannel](https://www.talos.dev/v1.6/kubernetes-guides/network/deploying-cilium/) instead of the
  default Flannel.
- It provides a lot of features like Network Policies, Load Balancing, and more.

### [Hcloud Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager)

- Updates the `Node` objects with information about the server from the Cloud , like instance Type, Location,
  Datacenter, Server ID, IPs.
- Cleans up stale `Node` objects when the server is deleted in the API.
- Routes traffic to the pods through Hetzner Cloud Networks. Removes one layer of indirection.
- Watches Services with `type: LoadBalancer` and creates Hetzner Cloud Load Balancers for them, adds Kubernetes
  Nodes as targets for the Load Balancer.

### [Talos Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos-cloud-controller-manager)

- [Applies labels to the nodes](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos-cloud-controller-manager?tab=readme-ov-file#node-initialize).
- [Validates and approves node CSRs](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos-cloud-controller-manager?tab=readme-ov-file#node-certificate-approval).
- In DaemonSet mode: CCM will use hostNetwork and current node to access kubernetes/talos API

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)

### Recommended Software

- [hcloud cli](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)
- [talosctl](https://www.talos.dev/v1.6/introduction/getting-started/#talosctl)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Hetzner Cloud

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have a Hetzner account yet, you are welcome to use
> this [Hetzner Cloud Referral Link](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=6Q6Q6Q6Q6Q6Q) to claim 20€ credit and support
> this project.

- Create a new project in the Hetzner Cloud Console
- Create a new API token in the project
- You can store the token in the environment variable `HCLOUD_TOKEN` or use it in the following commands/terraform
  files.

## Usage

### Packer

Create the talos os images (ARM and x86) via packer through running the [create.sh](_packer/create.sh).
It is using the `HCLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate against the Hetzner Cloud API and uses the project
of the token to store the images.
The talos os version is defined in the variable `talos_version`
in [talos-hcloud.pkr.hcl](_packer/talos-hcloud.pkr.hcl).

```bash
./_packer/create.sh
```

### Terraform

Use the module as shown in the following working example:

> [!NOTE]
> Actually, your current IP address has to have access to the nodes during the creation of the cluster.

```hcl
module "talos" {
  source  = "hcloud-talos/talos/hcloud"
  version = "the-latest-version-of-the-module"

  talos_version = "v1.7.5" # The version of talos features to use in generated machine configurations

  hcloud_token = "your-hcloud-token"

  cluster_name     = "dummy.com"
  cluster_domain   = "cluster.dummy.com.local"
  cluster_api_host = "kube.dummy.com"

  # If true, the current IP address will be used as the source for the firewall rules.
  # ATTENTION: to determine the current IP, a request to a public service (https://ipv4.icanhazip.com) is made.
  firewall_use_current_ip = true

  datacenter_name = "fsn1-dc14"

  control_plane_count       = 3
  control_plane_server_type = "cax11"

  worker_count       = 3
  worker_server_type = "cax21"
}
```

You need to pipe the outputs of the module:

```hcl
output "talosconfig" {
  value     = module.talos.talosconfig
  sensitive = true
}

output "kubeconfig" {
  value     = module.talos.kubeconfig
  sensitive = true
}
```

Then you can then run the following commands to export the kubeconfig and talosconfig:

```bash
terraform output --raw kubeconfig > ./kubeconfig
terraform output --raw talosconfig > ./talosconfig
```

Move these files to the correct location and use them with `kubectl` and `talosctl`.

## Additional Configuration Examples

### Kubelet Extra Args

```hcl
kubelet_extra_args = {
  system-reserved            = "cpu=100m,memory=250Mi,ephemeral-storage=1Gi"
  kube-reserved              = "cpu=100m,memory=200Mi,ephemeral-storage=1Gi"
  eviction-hard              = "memory.available<100Mi,nodefs.available<10%"
  eviction-soft              = "memory.available<200Mi,nodefs.available<15%"
  eviction-soft-grace-period = "memory.available=2m30s,nodefs.available=4m"
}
```

### Sysctls Extra Args

```hcl
sysctls_extra_args = {
  # Fix for https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/1176
  "net.core.rmem_default" = "26214400"
  "net.core.wmem_default" = "26214400"
  "net.core.rmem_max"     = "26214400"
  "net.core.wmem_max"     = "26214400"
}
```

### Activate Kernel Modules

```hcl
kernel_modules_to_load = [
  {
    name = "binfmt_misc" # Required for QEMU
  }
]
```

## Known Limitations

- Changes in the `user_data` (e.g. `talos_machine_configuration`) and `image` (e.g. version upgrades with `packer`) will
  not be applied to existing nodes, because it would force a recreation of the nodes.

## Known Issues

- `enable_alias_ip` can lead to error messages occurring during the first bootstrap.
  More about this here: https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/pull/8493
  If these error messages occur, one control plane must be restarted after complete initialisation once.
  This should resolve the error.
- IPv6 dual stack is not supported by Talos yet. You can activate IPv6 with `enable_ipv6`, but it should not have any
  effect.
- `enable_kube_span` let's the cluster not get in ready state. It is not clear why yet. I have to investigate it.
